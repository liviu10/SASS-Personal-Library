                    <p class="p-typography">
                        H.P. Lovecraft was born on August 20, 1890, in Providence, Rhode Island.
                        The horror magazine Weird Tales bought some of his stories in 1923.
                        His story "The Call of Cthulhu" came out in 1928 in Weird Tales.
                        Elements of this story would reappear in other related tales.
                        In his final years, he took editing and ghostwriting work to try to make ends meet.
                        He died on March 15, 1937, in Providence, Rhode Island.

                    <p class="p-typography">
                        A master of fantastical horror stories, H.P. Lovecraft was born
                        Howard Phillips Lovecraft in 1890, in Providence, Rhode Island.
                        Lovecraft had an unusual childhood marked by tragedy. His traveling salesman father developed a
                        type of mental disorder caused by untreated syphilis when he was around the age of three.
                        In 1893, his father became a patient at the Butler Hospital in Providence and there he remained
                        until his death in 1898.

                    <p class="p-typography">
                        A sickly child, Lovecraft spent many of his school years at home.
                        He became an avid reader, devouring works on a variety of texts.
                        Lovecraft loved the works of Edgar Allan Poe and developed a special interest in astronomy.
                        As a teenager, he did attend Hope High School, but he suffered a nervous breakdown before
                        he could earn his diploma. Lovecraft became a reclusive figure for several years,
                        choosing to stay up late studying and reading and writing and then sleeping late into the day.
                        During this time, he managed to publish some articles on astronomy in several newspapers.

                    <p class="article-section__title">Writing Career</p>
                    <p class="p-typography">
                        Lovecraft started out as a would-be journalist, joining the United Amateur
                        Press Association in 1914. The following year, he launched his self-published magazine
                        The Conservative for which he wrote several essays and other pieces.
                        While he had reportedly dabbled in fiction early on, Lovecraft became more serious
                        about writing stories around 1917. Many of these early works were influenced by
                        the writings of Lord Dunsany, an Irish author of fantasy tales, as well as Lovecraft's early
                        favorite Edgar Allan Poe.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-typography">
                        The horror magazine Weird Tales bought some of Lovecraft's stories in 1923,
                        giving him his first taste of literary success. The following year, he married Sonia Greene.
                        The couple lived together in New York City for two years before splitting up.
                        After his marriage failed, Lovecraft returned to Rhode Island and began work on some of his
                        best stories. "The Call of Cthulhu" came out in 1928 in Weird Tales,
                        and it perhaps best illustrated Lovecraft's efforts at creating an otherworldly type of terror.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-typography">
                        Lovecraft introduced readers to the first of many supernatural beings that
                        would wreak havoc on humankind. Elements of this story would reappear
                        in other related tales—collectively known by many as the "Cthulhu Mythos."
                        These later stories reflected Lovecraft's own philosophical ideals. According to
                        American Heritage magazine, Lovecraft once wrote, "all of my tales are based on the
                        fundamental premise that common human laws and emotions have no validity or
                        significance in the cosmos-at-large."

                    <p class="p-typography">
                        In his final years, Lovecraft was barely able to support himself.
                        He took editing and ghostwriting work to try to make ends meet.
                        Lovecraft died of cancer on March 15, 1937, in Providence, Rhode Island.
                        He left behind more than 60 short stories and a few novel and novellas,
                        including The Case of Charles Dexter Ward. Lovecraft's passing was mourned by his
                        devoted following of colleagues and aspiring writers with whom he corresponded and collaborated.
                        Two of these friends, August Derleth and Donald Wandrei, formed a publishing company
                        called Arkham House to promote and preserve Lovecraft's work.

                    <p class="p-typography">
                        Since his death, Lovecraft has earned greater acclaim than he enjoyed during his lifetime.
                        He has been an inspiration to such writers as Peter Straub,
                        Stephen King and Neil Gaiman. His stories have also served as the inspiration for numerous films,
                        including 2011's Hunters of the Dark and 2007's Cthulhu.
                        As Stephen King explained to American Heritage magazine, "Now that time has given us some perspective
                        on his work, I think it is beyond doubt that H.P. Lovecraft has yet
                        to be surpassed as the twentieth century's greatest practitioner of the classic horror tale."
